5 Routes Possible
    (1) Breadth-First Search (BFS):
        Pros: Guarantees the shortest path if all edges have the same weight
        Cons: Might require a lot of memory if the graph is large

    (2) Depth-First Search (DFS):
        Pros: Use less memory than BFS and can be more memory-efficient if the graph is very large and the solution path is deep
        Cons: Doesn't guarantee the shortest path

    (3) Dijkstra's Algorithm:
        Pros: Guarantees the shortest path for weighted graphs
        Cons: Slower on large graphs compared to BFS and DFS

    (4) A*:
        Pros: Efficient and optimal if a good heuristic is used
        Cons: Efficiency depends on the quality of the heuristic function
    
    (5) Bidirectional Search:
        Pros: Often faster than traditional algorithms
        Cons: Requires additional bookkeeping to ensure correctness
