You have to follow some steps in order to clone this repository on your local machine [whether your lab workstation, or your laptop, or both], then create a local branch if you want to make changes, then push those changes to a branch on Github, then others will review it and after all is good, you'll create a pull request so we bring those changes to the main branch on the GitHub repo.

Ask Soheil for the steps please.
