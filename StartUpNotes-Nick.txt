	Person looking towards us (left and right are switched)
Blood circulation:
	(1) Deoxygenated blood delivered to heart through superior and inferior vena cava
	(2) Heart pumps deoxygenated blood to lungs through pulmonary artery (blue) tree
			MAIN PULMONARY ARTERY = Root            
	(3) Blood becomes oxygenated and is transferred back to heart through pulmonary venous (red) tree
			MAIN PULMONARY VEINS = Usually 4. Connects back to heart through several "roots" as opposed to 1 with the main pulmonary artery
	(4) Blood is pumped from heart through the aorta to circulation
		From image we looked at, agent went from arm into vena cava into the heart then out into blue.
Image Volume Proprties
	Load segmentation as volume itself
	Care about image dimensions, spacing, and the Scalar Range (for CT images pertains to Attenuation Coefficient Hounsfield units. Air is ~-1024. Water ~0.)
Volume View
	vX3 take image of lungs, crop and upsampled (~0.7mm --> isotropic 0.38mm)

Created Virtual Environment
