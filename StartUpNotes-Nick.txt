Image Creation Code
	TLC = Total Lung Capacity (Full inflation)			FRC = Functional Residual Capacity (Middle of full inspiration and full expiration)
	*For ImageCreationCode, we are dealing with FRC files.
	
	.label and non-label files are similar. One is a segmentation and one is a label map.
		Segmentation or s-Final ~ Segmentation file that might have any random order or number of segments including M.
		Label map ~ Has taken original image and removes M (miscellaneous). This allows for scalar range to be 0, 1, or 2. Label is more standard while s-Final is nonstandard

	Opening as segment vs volume
		Segment ~
		Volume ~

	For path names, when storing prefixes utilize r"path".

	Shortcut to bring up terminal: Ctrl + '~'
	
	Segmentation vs Model/vtk
		Segmentation is a volume of values 0 and 1 while...
		Model or vtk is a collection of edges and vertices, or a mesh, as a representation.
		*For 3D representation, the vtk must be used.

		However, vtk conversion is not always needed EXCEPT when lungs and airways are involved.
	Decimation
		Use surface toolbox

	Purpose
		Using case 16, we want to write out into a file the lungs with arterial tree.
		Start off with vasculature. Find the angle which looks at the center of mass from 60cm away.
		One row and keep all of the columns.

	Notes during troubleshooting:
		Window levels describe the intensity range we want to map to the output image. It determines min and max pixel
		values. -1204 in Hounsfield units is the lowest intensity and corresponds to air. 650 is the max and corresponds
		with bone.

		
Next: Find issue with matplotlib inline, and continue looking into code.

Note: VsCode Terminal = Powershell NOT command prompt

Ran into issues in activating virtual environment. ALWAYS make sure you are installing packages into venvnick. Resolved using the following lines of code:
	(1) Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
	(2) .\venvnick\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Shortcut to run cell: Ctrl + Enter

Nate's Image Creation code
	In CaseImagesFinalDraft
		(1) Shows middle coronal slice while preserving scale.
		(2) Picks last s-final.nrrd, gets rid of M, then systematically visualizes it in a standard* fashion.     *3D visualization camera is set at an exact distance away from the trees. No need to change camera view 
		(3) Shows the lungs and pulmonary artery tree

		At the beginning, the code has functionality that traverses the entire "Done" images folder and picks the correct vx3's and s-final's.
		One cell is for reading the files, one to find images, and another to write out to the word document.

		Sorts through S-Segmentation (avm) files. There are many intermediates and one final (the last final) that is correct. Go through and compare each intermediate to the final, and create a word report of that. 90% Done
		Still need to create word doc that shows incorrect avm trees along with the correct avm tree. Will only 3 columns. Case, avm#, and avf.

		Had to install all import packages. Used ChatGPT to make sure each package was installed correctly.

		Worked on simplifying code. Instead of traversing entire Done folder, just pick out the specific case files and use them. Left off on brainstorming ideas on how to avoid traversing through whole done folder.

	Person looking towards us (left and right are switched)
Blood circulation:
	(1) Deoxygenated blood delivered to heart through superior and inferior vena cava
	(2) Heart pumps deoxygenated blood to lungs through pulmonary artery (blue) tree
			MAIN PULMONARY ARTERY = Root            
	(3) Blood becomes oxygenated and is transferred back to heart through pulmonary venous (red) tree
			MAIN PULMONARY VEINS = Usually 4. Connects back to heart through several "roots" as opposed to 1 with the main pulmonary artery
	(4) Blood is pumped from heart through the aorta to circulation
		From image we looked at, agent went from arm into vena cava into the heart then out into blue.
Image Volume Proprties
	Load segmentation as volume itself
	Care about image dimensions, spacing, and the Scalar Range (for CT images pertains to Attenuation Coefficient Hounsfield units. Air is ~-1024. Water ~0.)
Volume View
	vX3 take image of lungs, crop and upsampled (~0.7mm --> isotropic 0.38mm)
